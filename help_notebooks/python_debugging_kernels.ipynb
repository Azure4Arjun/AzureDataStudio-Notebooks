Jupyter kernel code is indirectly invoked by the jupyter command line tool. Therefore, you cannot launch and debug a Jupyter kernel module directly from VS Code with a launch configuration. Instead, you need to make slight modifications to your Jupyter kernel code to allow a Python debugger to attach to it.\n",
